# Build-a-Drum-Machine
# Description:
This pull request adds the implementation of a React-based Drum Machine, fulfilling the requirements as outlined in the user stories. The app features clickable drum pads, responsive keyboard interaction, and display of the corresponding sound ID. Additionally, the styling conforms to user-defined design specifications.

**Features**

 . Created a DrumPad component for each drum pad that plays a sound when clicked or when the corresponding key is pressed.
 . Each pad contains a label for its sound and is tied to an audio file.
 . Built the DrumMachine container that manages the drum pad layout and handles sound play and display functionality.
 . Utilized React’s useState to store the currently played sound and display it in the interface.
 . Handled event listeners for both clicks and keypresses.
